## Running the mustache.js test suite

The mustache.js test suite uses the [Buster.JS](http://busterjs.org/) testing framework and test runner. 

Buster.JS allows you to run the test suite against many different JS runtime engines.

Connect as many browsers as you want to run tests in. Current setup also tests mustache.js in node (V8).
